Airline Passengers Time Series Analysis and Forecast

In this jupyter notebook, we will try to analyze the data we have regarding the monthly count of airline passengers from 1949 to 1961. Then, we will try to predict the count of passengers for month for the next 3 years.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andreazzini/international-airline-passengers

Findings/ observations:
There is an overall upward trend in the number of airline passengers from 1949 to 1961.
There is a seasonal pattern for each year, which shows us a significant increase in the number of passengers around July to August (possibly summer) and a decrease in the late 3rd-4th quarter (possibly pre-winter to winter).
